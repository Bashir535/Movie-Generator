# Movie-Generator
Developed a Java based AI-tool that recommend the user a set of movies based on the users age, favorite genre, and style. Was able to use a Movie recommendation algorithm that used a database of movies which were categorized by age, genre, and more. It’s a web based interface and used an interactive command line to collect the users input.
